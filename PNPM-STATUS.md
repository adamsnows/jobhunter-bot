# JobHunter Bot - PNPM Workspace Status Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to set up the JobHunter Bot using pnpm workspace to manage frontend (Next.js) and backend (Flask API) with a single command.

## Changes Made

### Python Environment Configuration
1. Added `get_database_url()` function to `backend/src/models/database.py`
2. Improved backend setup command in `package.json` to include updated pip and wheel packages
3. Created diagnostic tool (`scripts/check_backend.py`) to help troubleshoot Python environment issues
4. Updated `pnpm_dev_server.py` to better handle Python virtual environment activation
5. Updated Makefile with new `backend-diagnostic` command

### Documentation
1. Updated `PNPM-WORKSPACE.md` with specific troubleshooting advice for Flask module errors
2. Updated `README.md` with improved instructions for PNPM workspace setup and troubleshooting

### Shell Scripts
1. Fixed script activation of Python virtual environment in `package.json`
2. Made `scripts/check_backend.py` executable

## Current Status

The PNPM workspace configuration is now working with some caveats:

1. The frontend (Next.js) starts properly on port 3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is taken)
2. The backend (Flask) now has the critical dependencies installed:
   - Flask 2.3.3
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.0.5
   - Flask-CORS 4.0.0
   - Other essential packages like psutil

3. There remains an issue with the spaCy and blis libraries, which are used for NLP functionality. These may require additional system-level dependencies or special installation flags on macOS.

## Recommendations for Moving Forward

1. **For basic usage**: The system should work for basic front/backend development using `pnpm run dev`

2. **For full NLP functionality**: You may need to install spaCy and its dependencies separately:
   ```bash
   cd backend && source venv/bin/activate
   ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip install --no-binary=blis blis
   pip install -U spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Diagnostic tool**: Use the new diagnostic tool when encountering issues:
   ```bash
   pnpm run backend:check
   # or
   make backend-diagnostic
   ```

4. **Production deployment**: Consider using Docker to avoid environment-specific issues

## Next Steps

1. Test the Flask app with a simpler endpoint that doesn't require NLP
2. Create a Docker setup as an alternative deployment option
3. Add detailed error handling in the pnpm script to better diagnose module import issues
